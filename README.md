# Electronic Queue System

## Overview

This project involves the development of an electronic queue management system using a Blue Pill STM32 microcontroller. The system is designed to streamline queue management in the electronics laboratory at UTFPR Campus Toledo. It utilizes infrared controls for queue registration and management, and displays the queue status through a Python user interface (UI).

## Features

- **Infrared Control Integration**: Teams and the professor use infrared controls to manage and monitor the queue. Teams enter the queue using their controls, while the professor uses a control to call students from the queue.
- **Queue Display**: The queue status and related information are displayed via a Python UI.
- **Microcontroller Code**: Implemented using C and PlatformIO, with no third-party libraries.
- **UI Implementation**: Python-based user interface with Tkinter.
